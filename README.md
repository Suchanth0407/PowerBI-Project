🌍 Global Economic and Demographic Trends Analysis


This project involves analyzing and visualizing global population, economic, and health data using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Descriptive Statistics. The aim is to uncover insights into country-level indicators like GDP, population, literacy, and more—delivered through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

📌 Objective

The primary objective is to build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard by:

Connecting datasets from multiple formats (SQL & Excel)

Cleaning, transforming, and integrating data

Performing descriptive statistical analysis

Visualizing key trends in population, economy, health, and geography

📂 Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following datasets:

CountriesWorld.sql

Contains country-level indicators like GDP per capita, population, infant mortality, etc.

CountriesWorld.xlsx

Excel version of the SQL dataset for quick inspection and analysis

GDP by Country (1960–2016).xlsx

Historical GDP data from the World Bank

PopulationPerCountry.csv

Population figures by country

MetaData Country.csv

Additional metadata for country classification

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Excel – Data cleaning and exploration

SQL – Data querying, filtering, and joining

Power BI – Data modeling, transformations (Power Query), and dashboard creation

Descriptive Statistics – Measures like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

📊 Key Metrics Analyzed

GDP per capita

Population size and density

Net migration

Literacy rate

Infant mortality

Geographical features (area, coastline ratio)

Regional aggregations

📈 Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard showcases:

Global population and GDP comparisons

Regional breakdowns of economic indicators

Health and education trends per country

Year-over-year GDP growth analysis (where applicable)

🧠 Statistical Techniques Used

Mean, median, mode

Standard deviation

Correlation between key indicators

Outlier detection and handling

🚀 Future Enhancements

Time-series forecasting of GDP or population using Python

Integration with live APIs for real-time dashboarding

Machine learning-based country clustering
